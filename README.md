CALCULATOR PROJECT

This project has used the languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I have also used a preprocessor called Sass to aid in styling with CSS.

The calculator can compute simple calculations with two numbers. 
It also has features such as clear, delete and 2DP (round to two decimal point).

Partial Sass files were used to create variables and to organise code.
